# My Todo App

A simple Todo app built with React. This app allows users to manage their tasks by marking them as completed and uncompleted.

## Features

- **Uncompleted Todos**: A list of tasks that need to be completed. You can filter and sort these tasks.
- **Completed Todos**: A list of tasks that have been completed. You can undo the completion to move them back to uncompleted.
- **Sorting**: Sort the uncompleted tasks alphabetically.
- **Filtering**: Filter todos based on user id (or sort them by username).
- **Uncomplete**: Move completed tasks back to the uncompleted list.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the app.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and functionality.
